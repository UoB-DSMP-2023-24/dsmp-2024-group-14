Problem Assigned: A

Group Members:Yingxue Guan, Xiaofei Song, Yijie Wang, Xuewen Sun


## Introduction

This project contains a series of tasks for processing TCR (T-cell receptor) data and performing related analysis. All code and data are included in the `allCode` folder.

## File Structure

- `allCode/`
  - `task1_data_process_all.ipynb`: Code for data preprocessing
  - `task3_distance_matrix_all.ipynb`: Code for calculating distance matrices
  - `task4_Dimensionality_Reduction.ipynb`: Code for plotting TCRs in 2D
  - `task5_hierarchical_clustering.ipynb`: Code for clustering TCRs
  - `task6_knn_all_results.ipynb`: Code for predicting antigen specificity
  - `data/`: Folder for storing all data
